Make your clock for the "Create a Client Side App" use angular to update the time. The Javascript should be executed in your controller and not in view, meaning your view should just read a value that's being modified in your controller. Also, create a button or multiple buttons to change the time zone. This can be as simple as +1 and -1 hour buttons or as complex as a dropdown menu for specific time zones. Submit as a pull request to your previous assignment.
